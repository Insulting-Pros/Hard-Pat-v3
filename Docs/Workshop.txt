Marco's latest version (v2.0) breaks servers - after you play once with it you will get invisible patriarchs for other votings / maps. Until you restart the server.

I fixed that bug and extended the mod a little bit.

Your perk stats won't save and if you are sad about this fact gtfo.

[h2][b]Changelog:[/b][/h2]
[list]
[*] Mutator doesn't affect default MonsterCollection and break the server after single usage. Its an optional bool and you can disable it if you use specific gametypes / mutators.
[*] Added Xmas, Circus, Halloween variants, controlled from config / WebAdmin / mutate commands.
[*] Added basic console commands with fancy colors. Type 'mutate PAT HELP' for additional info.
[*] Increased 'ImpaleMeleeDamageRange' to 85 (was 45) and decreased 'ClawMeleeDamageRange' to 75 (was 85), to match the animations.
[*] No more pipe detonation while escaping for heals.
[*] 'bHidden' flag is removed. Now pat should be visible during sneak state.
[*] Freshly spawned Pat should reach to players faster.
[*] Sharpshooter weapons deal onperk headshot damage while Pat is shooting machinegun. I.E. No more 1200dmg from onperk xbow...
